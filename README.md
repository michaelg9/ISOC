# ISOC

This is the Informatics Summer of Code project from Michael Michaelides and Tim Reichelt supervised by Hugh Leather.

If you have Docker then you should be able to run the server on your local machine. Just run 
```
docker-compose build  
docker-compose up 
```
in the root of the project to start the server (you only have to run the build command the first time you start the server). Then the server should run on localhost:3000. To shut it down you have to run 
```
docker-compose down
```
in a new terminal window.
