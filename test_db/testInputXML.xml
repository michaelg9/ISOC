<!--
Changes:
14/08:
Added <device> tag in metadata. This is the device ID that the server uses to identify the device (for now).

07/08:
<metadata> added timeZone attribute, since we're dealing with times.
<runservice> removed uid attribute
<installedapp> removed uid attribute
<sms>: retrieves the sms log.
    time is the time that the sms was receieved
    folder is one of all,inbox,sent,draft,outbox,failed,queued,unknown
    read indicates if the message was read (1) or not (0)
    the text is the replacement of the actual phone number
<connection>: the text goes from "proc" to the package name, as long as the corresponding package
    is registered in the installed apps database. If it's not, then the text will be
    "unknown". If the uid corresponds to multiple packages, they will appear next to each other
    separated by a /, like "com.google.android.gms/com.google.android.gsf". It means
    that one of these packages owns that connection. Also, uid attribute is removed.
    Additionally, sockets are broken from [ip]:[port] to separate attributes,
    for increased readability


26/07:
<action>: I removed the reboot action. It will now appear as a shutdown followed by a boot


22/07:
<uptime> in metadata becomes <lastReboot>
<runservice>: uptime removed. since attribute indicates when the service started, time attribute indicates the time of capture.
<call>: name attribute replaced by boolean saved attribute, which records if the number is registered as a contact. Additionally,
        the text of the tag that used to be the number dialled now is replaced by an arbitrary number
<battery>: charging value goes from boolean to one of: ac (when on a power socket), wireless (wireless charging source), usb,
        no (on battery),
        unknown(shouldnt appear under normal circumstances)
<wifiAP>: lists the APs that were found in the last wifi scan. caps are the capabilities of the AP, each in a seperate pair of brackets.
        signal is a number (worst)0-10(best). frequency is in MHz. The text is the SSID of the AP

21/07:
Added <defaultBrowser> tag in metadata. This is the default package name (not label) that android uses to open webpages.
Added temperature attribute to battery

<action>: text can be either boot, shutdown, reboot, airplaneOn (airplane mode), airplaneOff

<connection>:   time is the time that the connection was captured by the monitoring application
                local is the local socket, in ipv4 or ipv6 format
                remote is the remote socket
                type is the type of the connection: tcp / tcp6 / udp / udp6 / raw / raw6
                status:  one of these (taken by the linux source):
                        UNKNOWN, ESTABLISHED, SYN_SENT, SYN_RECV, FIN_WAIT1, FIN_WAIT2, TIME_WAIT, CLOSE,
                        CLOSE_WAIT, LAST_ACK, LISTEN, CLOSING, NEW_SYN_RECV, MAX_STATES
                uid is the uid of the program that created the socket
                text is currently set to "proc" for all entries, planned to be the process name soon



17/07
Removed the datastate tag from metadata. I realised that this is already covered with <data> and
    it's also variable so I shouldn't put it in metadata in the first place

Battery: Logged each time you plug it into a power source, when the battery reaches LOW and
    after it recovers from LOW

06/07:
Metadata:
	IMEI: unique, could be used as they device id: 15 or 17 digits(google says)
	datanettype: the mobile data network available: "unknown" "gprs","edge","umts","cdma","evdo0",
            "evdoA","1xrtt","hsdpa","hsupa","hspa","iden","evdoB","lte","ehrpd","hspap"
	datastate: mobile data state: disconnected/connecting/connected/suspended
	network: the network operator's name that the phone is connected to
        carrier:  the sim operator's name. Can be different from <network> when the carrier is actually
            using another operator's network (e.g. giffgaff) or when roaming I guess
	uptime: seconds since device booted

runservice:
	uid: user-id: id given by os to each installed application. However, a few apps may share the same the same uid though,
            only if they are signed with the same key though (e.g. LG apps).
	uptime: seconds since the service started running
	rx: received bytes (from any intf) by this uid since device boot. -1 if this feature is unsupported
	tx: transmitted bytes (from any intf) by this uid since device boot. -1 if this feature is unsupported
	the name of the package that the service belongs to is unique


data: Network data statistics

	active: true if the respective interface is currently active
        time: time when the statistic was collected
        since: last time that we can capture info about this device. **For now it's until last reboot. I plan to
            make them survive reboot soon
        rx: bytes received with this intf since the <since> date
	tx: bytes transmitted with this intf since the <since> date
	the text is either wifi or mobile.

installedapp: Installed applications.
	name: the official name of the package, unique.
        installed: date of first install  **some apps report a really old date, I'll find out why soon....
        uid as before.
        the text is the label of the package, not unique but more user-friendly (the name shown under the app's icon). if
            it doesn't have one, this will be the same as name attribute



29/06:
Added charging attribute to battery tag: true/false
Added name attribute to call tag. Retrieved from the contacts list or "Unknown" if it's an unsaved number


- wrap all the tracked data into a "device-data" tag
- remove "unit" element from "battery" element
- "time" attribute is now a timestamp with a date
