Changes:
17/07
Removed the datastate tag from metadata. I realised that this is already covered with <data> and
    it's also variable so I shouldn't put it in metadata in the first place

Battery: Logged each time you plug it into a power source, when the battery reaches LOW and 
    after it recovers from LOW

06/07:
Metadata:
	IMEI: unique, could be used as they device id: 15 or 17 digits(google says)
	datanettype: the mobile data network available: "unknown" "gprs","edge","umts","cdma","evdo0",
            "evdoA","1xrtt","hsdpa","hsupa","hspa","iden","evdoB","lte","ehrpd","hspap"
	datastate: mobile data state: disconnected/connecting/connected/suspended
	network: the network operator's name that the phone is connected to 
        carrier:  the sim operator's name. Can be different from <network> when the carrier is actually 
            using another operator's network (e.g. giffgaff) or when roaming I guess
	uptime: seconds since device booted 

runservice:
	uid: user-id: id given by os to each installed application. However, a few apps may share the same the same uid though, 
            only if they are signed with the same key though (e.g. LG apps).
	uptime: seconds since the service started running
	rx: received bytes (from any intf) by this uid since device boot. -1 if this feature is unsupported
	tx: transmitted bytes (from any intf) by this uid since device boot. -1 if this feature is unsupported
	the name of the package that the service belongs to is unique


data: Network data statistics
    
	active: true if the respective interface is currently active
        time: time when the statistic was collected
        since: last time that we can capture info about this device. **For now it's until last reboot. I plan to 
            make them survive reboot soon 
        rx: bytes received with this intf since the <since> date
	tx: bytes transmitted with this intf since the <since> date
	the text is either wifi or mobile.

installedapp: Installed applications.
	name: the official name of the package, unique.
        installed: date of first install  **some apps report a really old date, I'll find out why soon....
        uid as before.
        the text is the label of the package, not unique but more user-friendly (the name shown under the app's icon). if 
            it doesn't have one, this will be the same as name attribute



29/06:
Added charging attribute to battery tag: true/false
Added name attribute to call tag. Retrieved from the contacts list or "Unknown" if it's an unsaved number


- wrap all the tracked data into a "device-data" tag
- remove "unit" element from "battery" element
- "time" attribute is now a timestamp with a date
